# My Way of Working

“I’ve worked on effective waterfall projects but since the uptake of Lean and Agile practices in User Experience, coupled with strong design-led, data-driven activities and practices, I now see how incredible ideas can come to life, slowly and more efficiently and users can benefit sooner.”

## Early project involvement

### 1. Understanding the needs of the client and the user
Identifying user pain points or insights, marrying them with business goals via a series of workshops, interviews, User research and analysis enables me, to begin to define what the goal of the project is and define hypotheses behind it.

### 2. Understanding what’s out there now, current tools apps and competitors
Depending on whether a project is looking to enhance a current site, app or product or to deliver a completely new one, doing comprehensive research into the competitor market as well as retrieving any data the client has on their own customer activity is critical to UX.

### Understanding the user
The U in UX is there for a reason and identifying, learning about and trying to empathise with users is a skill us UXers must be able to display. I review the analytics and information we have about users and help create hypotheses that can be tested against any solution, prototype or research presented.

## Standard UX activities

### 1. Personas
- Talk with current customers or users
- Ensure I have the right age range, gender etc
- I make sure I can identify their wants and needs
- I always introduce the wider team to the personas - full-size cardboard cut outs ensures the whole team doesn’t forget them

### 2. User scenarios and journeys
- Can be detailed or high-level
- Reflects journey, not designs
- Should be reviewed and used by Agile testers and developers to aid their work
- Useful as tool in Agile estimation and planning
- Great for use in defining data flows as well

### 3. Information Architecture
- Initially, I focus structure - what am I trying to present?
- Start with a sitemap, if relevant, rarely isn’t.
- Logical categorisation and position of content helped by card sort
- Consider navigation
- Validate with content owners and providers

### 4. Sketching through to wireframes
- I ensure I understand what I’m trying to demonstrate.
- I sketch on whiteboard with team participating
- Develop initial concept sketches and user flows to help get consensus on what the team are trying to achieve
- Validate and test with users and stakeholders

### 5. Prototyping
- I use Figma for simpler prototypes and Axure RP for fully functional prototypes
- Develop more detailed interactive prototypes possibly applying brand and UI designs using software such as Adobe Photoshop, Axure or Figma
- A prototype allows fully functional components to be tested with stakeholders and users.
- Great for Agile testing

### 6. User testing / Usability testing
- I write test scripts and define, with Agile (TDD and BDT) testers, success criteria
- I have managed third-party and dedicated in-house user testing teams
- Always prefer to test every possible iteration of prototype or live software as it is iteratively developed
- Run surveys with users to evaluate how deliverables meet, or not, the hypotheses set out.
